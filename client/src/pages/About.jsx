              Welcome to Jasmine's Blog! This is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

              This app was created by Jasmine, an aspiring frontend engineer studying at NYU. 
              Her passion for frontend development ignited in 2022 during an internship at PwC Shanghai, and it continued to grow during her 1-year full-time role at a Fintech startup in Hong Kong, where she built a BtoB loan platform.

            <p>
            Jasmine continues to learn and grow at NYU. She worked on a group project using Django, where she experienced the full web development cycleâ€”from product design, development to CI/CD and deployment. She also completed this blog as a solo project.
